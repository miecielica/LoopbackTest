# Loopback SDK for Xamarin

The repository contains the LoopBack Xamarin SDK, including the `lb-xm` script that
creates a Xamarin client to call a LoopBack server backend API.

## Set up ##

### Windows / MacOS

Run `npm install` in shell.

After setup, to compile an SDK, make sure you have all the dependencies and run this command:

```
node lb-xm d:\someserver\server\server.js dll
```

Where the first parameter is the main application file of the Loopback server, and `dll` is a DLL compilation flag.

To review the C# part of the generator (source code of lb-xm/bin/LBXamarinSDKGenerator.dll), look at the `LBXamarinSDK.sln` solution.

To review simple example apps using a compiled SDK, see the folder "examples".
This folder contains a LoopBack server and a Xamarin solution of an Android app using the SDK, and a second LoopBack server and a Visual Studio solution of a console application using the SDK.

## Basic procedure ##

To create a Xamarin client based on a LoopBack API:

1. Go into `bin`
2. Create CS code for the SDK; for example:
 ```
 node lb-xm d:\someserver\server\server.js
 ```
3. Compile an SDK DLL; for example:
 ```
 node lb-xm d:\someserver\server\server.js dll
 ```
 - To ensure compatibility with Xamarin-Forms, add the flag 'forms', e.g. `node lb-xm d:\someserver\server\server.js forms`.

In addition the C# source files are in C# directory, accessed by `LBXamarinSDK.sln`.
This contains the open-source of the C# part of the generator. This project's end result is `LBXamarinSDKGenerator.dll` that
is placed automatically as a post-build event inside the `bin` directory.

The C# project also contains testers for the lb-xm end result, for which we have the "test-server" folder, upon which the Testers act.
The "examples" folder contains an example server and Xamarin solution of an App using a compiled SDK, and also a second example LoopBack server and a Visual Studio solution of a console application using the SDK.
Last folder is "UnitTests", containing Testers for the project: it should get an input of the CS code generated by lb-xm.

## Testers for LBXamarinSDK ##

The unit tests are in the `C#\lb-xmTesters` folder.
It contains a Xamarin/Visual Studio testing solution on the test-server.

**IMPORTANT**: The Testing unit is an example of building tests for a server.
Classes in `LBXamarinSDK.cs` are calibrated to work with the test server, and created specifically for that server.
You must recompile `LBXamarinSDK.cs` when you change the server.

### Setting up testers ###

**Install Server**

1. Go into test-server and run 'npm install' in terminal/shell

**Visual Studio**

**NOTE**: It is important to do the setup while the project is open.

1. Open `lb-xmTesters.csproj`  in `C#\lb-xmTesters`.
1. Make sure you have NuGet installed:
 - Tools-> Extensions and Updates.
 - Select online on left tab.
 - Search for NuGet Package manager.
1. Make sure you have NUnit testing adapter installed; for instructions, see http://nunit.org/index.php?p=vsTestAdapter&r=2.6.3

**Xamarin**

No special setup is needed.

### Running Tests###

**All platforms**

1. Go into `test-server` and enter `slc run`.  (NOTE: If the server was already run, close and run it again)
**Important** Do this each time you run a test, as test change data in the server.
2. If you made changes to the test-server:
 - Compile a new `LBXamatinSDK.cs` and replace the existing one (`node lb-xm SERVERPATH`).
 - Make sure that the code corresponds to changes on expected test results

**Visual Studio**

1. Open `lb-xmTesters.csproj` located in `C#\lb-xmTesters`.
2. Choose Test -> Windows -> Test Explorer.
3. The first time you run tests click Run All in the tab that opens.

For more information on NUnit, see http://nunit.org/index.php?p=vsTestAdapter&r=2.6.3.

**Xamarin**

1. Open `LBXamarinSDK.sln`.
2. Right-click "lb-xmTesters" in the Solution Explorer -> run unit.


### Contribution Workflow to the SDK Generator ###

* Write a failing test of the desired feature in `lb-xmTest`.
* Make changes to the SDK Generator C# project and/or test server and/or JS Code.
* Build the SDKGenerator C# project.
* Run `lb-xm` to create a CS file and put it into the Testers project.
* Run test and check feature functionality.
